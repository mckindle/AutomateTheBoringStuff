## Version 1
# I started off by making some code that constantly asked you to enter a number
# Based on that number it would do one of the two outcomes.

def collatz():
    global number
    number = input("Pick a number ")

def askAgain():
    collatz()
    try:
        val = int(number)
        if (int(number) % 2) == 0:
            print(number, 'divided by 2 is', int(number) // 2)
            askAgain()
        else:
            print(number,'x 3 + 1 =',(int(number)) * 3 + 1)
            askAgain()
    except ValueError:
        print('umm... "'+number+'"', "is not a number...")
        askAgain()
        
askAgain()

##Version 2
# I kind of realised that the point of defining a function was to make it easier to call over and over again.
# Since I had put most of the function in the 'askAgain' in the first version while testing, I decided to move it into the collatz() function itself this time.
# I also no longer needed to print the formulae in the final version, and instead replaced all of that with a simple print() and return.
# I put both the print and return in an abs() because otherwise it was printing the formulae and not the result.

def collatz(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number//2)
        return number//2

    elif number % 2 == 1:
        print(abs(3 * number + 1))
        return abs(3 * number + 1)

# however I did want to retain some of the askAgain() principals:
# so I included some validation to check the answer was an integer.  I didn't know what the error was until it failed and then I used the error type to create the 'except'.
# and said that while the answer isn't 1 it will continue to perform collatz, inserting the answer as the number as defined in the collatz() function.
# when the answer becomes 1 the code will move on, and as part of the if statement the question will get asked again. 
# I don't need to include an else because any alternatives were already included as part of the while loop.

def askAgain():  
    try:
        answer = input("Give me a number: ")
        while answer != 1:
                answer = collatz(int(answer))
        if answer == 1:
            askAgain()
    except ValueError:
        print('umm... "'+answer+'"', "is not a whole number...")
        askAgain()
