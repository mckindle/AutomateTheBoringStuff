Q1: dictionary = {}

Q2: dictionary = {'foo': '42'} 

Q3: 
  - dictionaries cannot be sorted, a list can be sorted by it's values.
  - dictionaries contain pairs of keys and values, which together are called items.  A list only containes values.

Q4: KeyError: 'foo'

Q5: There is no difference between 'cat' in spam OR 'cat' in spam.keys() as they both search for the keys within the items.

Q6: 'cat' in spam: searches the keys within the items of spam
     whereas 'cat' in spam.values() will search specifically for the values within the items of spam.

Q7: spam.setdefault('colour', 'black')
      is an easier way to write:

if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'

Q8:
