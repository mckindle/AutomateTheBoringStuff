Q:1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True and False, written with a Capital


Q:2. What are the three Boolean operators?

AND, OR, NOT


Q:3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

True and True = True
True and False = False
False and True = False
False and False = False

True or True = True
True or False = False
False or True = True
False or False = False

not True = False
not False = True


Q:4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  =False
not (5 > 4)   = False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)   =True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))   =False
(True and True) and (True == False)   =False
(not False) or (not True)   =True


Q:5. What are the six comparison operators?
==, !=, <, >, >=, <=


Q:6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

== compares values, including deducted values.
= is not a comparison operator it assignes a value to a variable.


Q:7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

Conditions are expressions that evaluate down to a Boolean value (True or False(=), with a flow control statement deciding what to do based on the outcome.


Q8:Identify the three blocks in this code:

The block starts with the first if statement, then the second is a new block and the else is a block.
             spam = 0
Block1:      if spam == 10:
Block2:         print('eggs')
                if spam > 5:
                  print('bacon')
                else:
Block3:           print('ham')
              print('spam')
          print('spam')
          
          
Q:9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
