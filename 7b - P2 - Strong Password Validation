##Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password
##string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that
##is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase
##characters, and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string
##against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.

import re, pyperclip

# I created a regex for each of the qualities I wanted to password to have separately.
lenRegex = re.compile('\w{8,}')
lowRegex = re.compile(r'.*[a-z].*')
uppRegex = re.compile(r'.*[A-Z].*')
numRegex = re.compile(r'.*\d.*')


# Find matches in clipboard text (must have something on clipboard before running, for quickness of testing multiple passwords at once for this exercise)
text = str(pyperclip.paste())
matches = []

# First I'm checking that the length is valid
# then, only if the length in valid I am asking if what gets passed matches having a lower, upper and number character.  
for passwords in lenRegex.findall(text):
    if lowRegex.search(passwords) and uppRegex.search(passwords) and numRegex.search(passwords):
        matches.append(passwords)
    
# Copy results to the clipboard.
if len(matches) > 0:
    pyperclip.copy('\n'.join(matches))
    print('Copied to clipboard:')
    print('\n'.join(matches))
else:
    print('No Valid Passwords')
